    <h1>Katie Roberts</h1>
    <em>Interactive Designer</em>
    <p>Katie is simply amazing.  We don't know what we would do without her.
      She not only is fluent the Adobe Suite for quick mock-ups and chop-ups, but
      she is also brilliant at cutting up designs into HTML and CSS.
      Since she works right in the repo, her work is essential to keeping our team flexible and AGILE. And she's cute.
